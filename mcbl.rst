MCIC Computational Biology Lab (MCBL)
*************************************

Our goal
--------
Our mission is to build core support and intellectual leadership in the area of bioinformatics
to support research at the OARDC, by providing an engaging work environment, space, infrastructure
and training for performing research involving biological data analysis.

We  aspire for the MCBL to become the place to be for learning and performing bioinformatics research at the OARDC,
the place where ideas are discussed and exchanged, students and users learn from each other and get help and support
from our experienced staff when needed, and we as a community move our bioinformatics knowledge forward.

We specialize in working with High-throughput Sequencing (HTS) data and providing training in
reproducible science using modern tools.

We are happy to help you to carry out your own analysis. This will include helping with experimental design,
discussing the most effective way to carry out your data analysis, providing the computational
infrastructure (software, scripts and computers), interpreting results,
and answering questions you might come across along the way. 
We can also process and analyze HTS data for you, using either standardized or custom pipelines.
