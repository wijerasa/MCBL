**********************************************
 MCIC Computational Biology Lab
**********************************************

Our Goal
---------
Our mission is to build core support and intellectual leadership in the area of bioinformatics
to support research at the OARDC, by providing an engaging work environment, space, infrastructure
and training for performing research involving biological data analysis.

We  aspire for the MCBL to become the place to be for learning and performing bioinformatics research at the OARDC,
the place where ideas are discussed and exchanged, students and users learn from each other and get help and support
from our experienced staff when needed, and we as a community move our bioinformatics knowledge forward.

We specialize in working with High-throughput Sequencing (HTS) data and providing training in
reproducible science using modern tools.
