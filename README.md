# MCBL website
This is the repo from which the MCBL website at https://mcbl.readthedocs.io/ is built.

The MCBL is the Computational Biology Lab of Ohio State University's Molecular and Cellular Imaging Center in Wooster, OH.

The site was originally created by Sarange Wijeratne and is now being maintained by Jelmer Poelstra.
